## Where to start ?

It depends on your `webpack` skills.

If webpack is a very new concept/tool for you, you should start with [novice first step :baby:](novice/basics.md).
If you didn't have a chance to start using webpack from scratch, you should start with [novice koâns :pushpin:](novice/novice-koans.md). If it is too hard for you _Novice_ steps are here for you.

If you think you are mastering webpack novice concepts, you can start directly with the [first intermediate step](intermediate/dev.md).
