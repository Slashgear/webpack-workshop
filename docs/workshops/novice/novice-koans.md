## Introduction

This _Koâns_ is to test your knowledge after all the **Novice** steps.
If you consider you have the novice knowledges about Webpack, this will be very easy for you.

You have here a very simple web application coded in the `index.html` file.
All you have to do is to setup the webpack config to split all the _hardcoded_ Javascript, CSS and HTML into separated files.

::: tip
You already have all the dependencies you will need for this.

## Definition of done

- You have to generated a `main.js` bundle
- Your `index.html` file should be generated with webpack and bundles should be automatically added.
- External libs should be imported by webpack and not by _CDN_.
- All the generated files should be in the `dist` folder.
- `<style/>` should injected in the bundle.
